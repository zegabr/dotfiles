## What it has?
- neovim (as a fully featured IDE) + tmux + rust useful CLIs

## if you want an adventure, here is how to use it
- For ssh key setup + core features like tmux, nvim, and CLI tools, run:
    - `bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zegabr/dotfiles/main/scripts/scripts/stuff/ssh.sh)`
    - `bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zegabr/dotfiles/main/scripts/scripts/setup_core.sh)`
- For other desktop applications on Debian distros, try:
    - `bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zegabr/dotfiles/main/scripts/scripts/setup_extra.ss`

## TODO:
- learn how to use and setup debbuger for languages like go, rust, and maybe typescript for neovim

## reminder to the creator
- should add flameshot shortcut manually
