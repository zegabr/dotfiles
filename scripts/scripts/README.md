# What the scripts do
Run `bash setup_core.sh` for basic setup including bash aliases, nvim, tmux, starship, rust tooling like ripgrep, bat etc. I'll use this for a initial setup in work ubuntu/debian machines

Run `bash setup_extra.sh` for extra stuff I use in dual boot setup for a personal computer

Run `bash c.sh` if you want my competitive setup (vim, c++ and [cp](https://github.com/zegabr/cp)) (you probably won't want it)

Run `bash m.sh` to get full setup (one liner it is!)

See stuff/ for other configuration scripts i use inside the ones mentioned above
