Usefull scripts for linux setup/productivity (at least I find it usefull).

# What the scripts do
Run `bash setup.sh` for basic setup (take a look at the file stuff/apps.sh first so you don't install things you don't want).

Run `bash ssh.sh` to setup default ssh key for github.

Run `bash add-ssh.sh` to add a new ssh key for github (usefull if you use more than one git account on the same pc).

Run `source z.sh` if you want to install zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/README.md)

Run `source stuff/custom-keybindings.sh` to add keyboard shortcuts (for now it only adds flameshot for now and it *overrides all custom shortcuts* previously added)

Run `source c.sh` if you want my competitive setup (vim, c++ and [cp](https://github.com/zegabr/cp)) (you probably won't want it)

Run `source v.sh` if you want to build neovim from source (with vim-plug instalation)

Run `source t.sh` if you want tmux

Run `source f.sh` for fira code fonts (must change on terminal preferences later as I didn't find how to do it automatically)

Run `source m.sh` to get full setup (one liner it is!). This do not install zsh anymore
