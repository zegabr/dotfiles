# What the scripts do
Run `bash setup_core.sh` for basic setup including bash aliases, nvim, tmux, starship, rust tooling like ripgrep, bat etc. I'll use this for a initial setup in work ubuntu/debian machines

Run `bash setup_extra.sh` for extra stuff I use in dual boot setup for a personal computer

Run `bash stuff/ssh.sh` to setup default ssh key for github.

Run `bash stuff/add-ssh.sh` to add a new ssh key for github (usefull if you use more than one git account on the same pc).

Run `source c.sh` if you want my competitive setup (vim, c++ and [cp](https://github.com/zegabr/cp)) (you probably won't want it)

Run `source v.sh` if you want to build neovim from source

Run `source m.sh` to get full setup (one liner it is!)
